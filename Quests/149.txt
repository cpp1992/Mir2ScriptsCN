[@Description]
Now, let me test you once more
Pass through an ordeal I have prepared and bring me some
恶魔脑浆. If you do this, then I'll tell you the way to
get the 赤月魔剑

[@TaskDescription]

[@Completion]
What is in the bottle is the foul blood of a 赤月恶魔 I killed...
If you disguised yourself as a demon of a man by
smearing it on your clothes and holding an EvilHeart
You can get the 赤月魔剑. To kill the 赤月恶魔 and
To get rid of the origin of the demon depends upon you.
It is hard for you to kill a 赤月恶魔 alone,
Band together with many other heroes..
